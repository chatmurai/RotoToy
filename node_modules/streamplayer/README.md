This is a very simple module to allow playing audio streams via mpg321.

The standard method to play MP3 on nodejs appears to be to use a combination of
the excellent [lame](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lame) and 
[speaker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speaker) modules. There are two reasons
why you might prefer to use streamplayer instead:

1. streamplayer does not require compilation of lame or mpg321 (only the
   very simple mkfifo), making it much less likely to break for nodejs
   changes.
2. streamplayer sends events with progress information during playback.

Usage is very simple:

```javascript
const StreamPlayer = require('streamplayer');

var player = new StreamPlayer();
var mp3_stream = yourFunc();

player.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished!');
});

player.on('progress', info => {
  console.log(`Played ${info.progress}%`);
});

player.play(mp3_stream);
```
